## Description
The project uses SM-24 Geophone to detect footsteps and other low-frequency actions in its surrounding environment. Hardware details and [schematics](https://github.com/jb2328/Geophone_Project/blob/master/Hardware/Schematics/SM-24%20RPi%20Schematic.pdf) can be found in the Hardware folder.

To house the sensor, a case was designed in Rhino and 3D printed using Ultimaker 2 printer. The casing allows for the sensor to move freely and always be able to be in contact with the floor or other surface to be measured.

Lastly, two Python scripts were written to visualise data either using the built-in 1.8in LCD screen or using Matplotlib on an external monitor.
